# This is the correct solution which passes all tests
# The implementation is similar to the first one, but goes one step further
# Instead of calculating price directly, it finds a max combination of books from the cart first and then
# store it in a cum_list list. So the list should something like [5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1]
# then replace a 5 and 3 with two 4s, so make it [5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1]
# After reshuffle the combinations, the correct total price can be calculated.
