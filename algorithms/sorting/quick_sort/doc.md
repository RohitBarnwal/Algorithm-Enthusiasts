# Quick Sort

Quick sort is also a divide and conquer sorting algorithm like merge sort.

The basic idea is selecting a threshold and put all items smaller on its left side, and the rest on the right side, 
apply this recursively and at the end, the whole array will be sorted.

the time is O(N*LogN) and the space is O(1)
